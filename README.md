# LIC-image-analyser
Superpose and analyse images from different measurments of the same object

problems in V30:
* After fit going back to im2 uncheck+recheck finished ckbox inverts the ref and float image
(do it 2 times to get the right plots in tab4)
* Double crop error in tab3 (floating image)

--------------------
V30 can normalize the data an dputw axes labels in the pixel cloud on tab4
But there is still the double crop error in tab3
